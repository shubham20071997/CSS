The CSS @import has a major drawback due to performance issues; it creates an extra HTTP request each time you call it. 
However, the Sass @import includes the file in the CSS; so no extra HTTP call is required at runtime!

Syntax
@import filename;

Sass Partials
Sass transpiles all the .scss files directly. However, when we want to import a file, we do not need the file to be transpiled directly & for this we use underscore before the file name.
Sass Partial Syntax:
_filename;
